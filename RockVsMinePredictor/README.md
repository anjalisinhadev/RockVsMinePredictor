 
## Rock vs Mine Predictor

This is a simple logistic regression model that classifies sonar signals as either **rock** or **mine** using the [Sonar dataset from Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/rupakroy/sonarcsv).

### Model Used

* **Logistic Regression** from `scikit-learn`

### Accuracy

* Achieved an accuracy of **83%** on the test set.
